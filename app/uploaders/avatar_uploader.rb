  storage :file

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)

  version :microthumb do
    process :resize_to_fill => [20, 20]
